        <h2>The Proposal</h2>
        <p>
            On the last day of a trip to San Francisco in 2022, Kara and 
            Ryan went north to visit the Muir Woods Monument. Ryan brought 
            the ring, not knowing whether or not he would pop the question, 
            nor did he have any plan that day to propose, but he was watching 
            for the right opportunity, the right moment should it present 
            itself. As they walked the trails winding between the trees, 
            they took in the nature and beauty around them. The air was
            filled with the scents of redwood, water, and earth. Toward the 
            end of the trail, adjacent to their path, Ryan saw a bridge crossing 
            a small stream cutting through the woods. It seemed to him 
            picturesque and a focal point of this part of the trail. "That's the 
            spot." he thought to himself. He took note of it as they continued 
            on the trail. It would give him time to think of how to pop the question,
            what to say. Though he had thought for months about this moment, 
            he didn't know what he would say. He didn't want to sound corny or
            cliche, but how would he go about this? It was starting to get 
            late and they turned to head back to the car. Their path didn't 
            take them across the bridge, but as they were going to pass it,
            Ryan stopped. "Hey, come with me over here for a minute" he said 
            while nodding toward the bridge. Kara seemed a little confused as to
            why, but she did as he asked.

            The light was beginning to fade and the forest obscured much of the light, 
            but the bridge was illuminated by the break in the trees above it. They 
            stepped to the middle of the small bridge and he turned and put his
            arms around her. Still not sure of what all he should say, he rambled 
            about how bright their future together seemed. New jobs, he finished 
            school the previous year, they had never been in a better place. He told 
            her he loved her and this seemed right. He then discreetly took a coin
            out of his pocket and dropped it on the ground, making an audible ring. 
            He said, "I'll get that", then kneeled down to get the coin while 
            simultaneously taking the ring out of his pocket. He looked up at her with 
            a smile and offered up the ring. "Will you be my bride?" he asked. She 
            gave an enthusiastic ”YES!”.
